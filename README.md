# 🎬 Movie Dataset Analysis & Visualization Project

This project focuses on **analyzing and visualizing movie data** using Python libraries such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
It helps understand patterns in movie budgets, revenues, genres, ratings, and other cinematic factors that influence success.

## 🧠 Objectives of the Project
The main goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a movie dataset to uncover insights about:
- Movie budgets vs box office performance  
- IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes rating trends  
- Popular genres and directors  
- Growth of movie industry over time  
- Profitability and revenue patterns

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data loading and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive data exploration

### **Q1. Basic Exploration**
- Checked dataset shape, column names, and data types.  
- Found unique movies, genres, directors, and lead actors.  
- Handled missing values and displayed summary statistics.

### **Q2. Univariate Analysis**
- Histogram of movie release years and IMDb ratings.  
- Top 5 movie genres.  
- Average movie budget by country.

### **Q3. Bivariate Analysis**
- Relationship between **Budget** and **Global Box Office**.  
- Average IMDb rating across genres.  
- Correlation between **Budget** and **Rotten Tomatoes Score**.  
- Comparison of **US vs Global Box Office** by genre.  
- Relationship between **Opening Day** and **First Week Sales**.

### **Q4. Time-Based Analysis**
- Number of movies released per year (trend).  
- Average budget growth per decade.  
- IMDb rating trend over years.  
- Most popular genres since 2000.  
- Global Box Office revenue before vs after 2000.

### **Q5. Categorical Insights**
- Top 10 directors by IMDb rating.  
- Lead actors with the most movies.  
- Countries producing the most films.  
- Genre with highest US vs Global ratio.  
- IMDb vs Rotten Tomatoes score comparison by genre.

### **Q6. Advanced / Critical Thinking**
- Correlation between IMDb ratings and Global Box Office.  
- Percentage of high-budget movies that failed to profit.  
- Most profitable genres (Revenue/Budget ratio).  
- Rotten Tomatoes vs First Week Sales relation.  
- Correlation heatmap among numeric columns.

### **Q7. Visualization Ideas**
- Correlation heatmap.  
- Bubble chart (Budget vs Revenue vs Votes).  
- Pie chart for Genre distribution.  
- Boxplot of IMDb ratings by genre.  
- Trend line of IMDb ratings over release years.
