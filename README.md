# 🎬 Movie Dataset Analysis & Visualization Project

This project focuses on **analyzing and visualizing movie data** using Python libraries such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
It helps understand patterns in movie budgets, revenues, genres, ratings, and other cinematic factors that influence success.

## 🧠 Objectives of the Project
